Connected: [[Road Through the Feywild Leak]], [[the trek]], [[Old King's Road]]

**TLDR:** 
- Always add one “wrong” detail
	- Trees: leaves always rustle like whispering voices.
	- River: flows uphill, but only when you watch it.
	- Moon: visible at noon, but only reflected in water.
- Make social > combat by default
	- The first “attack” is usually: A prank, A riddle, A game, A test, Or a bargain.
	- Even hostile things can be bargained with, tricked, or overperformed.
	- You can still absolutely have fights – they just often have non-fighty outs.
- Use prices that aren’t hit
	- When Fey want something, think beyond gold: A favourite memory, The colour of a PC’s eyes (they change afterwards), One secret, spoken aloud, A vow to do something later, A feeling (“your ability to feel fear for a day”).
- Let the world react to emotions
	- When someone is furious, the wind picks up or candles gutter.
	- When someone is terrified, shadows lengthen or trees lean away.
	- When someone makes a heartfelt promise, distant thunder or a flash of colour marks it.
- Tuning danger level
	- Feywild is often portrayed as chaotic-neutral dangerous: Hags, cruel pranksters, and predatory courts exist alongside genuinely delightful and helpful beings. A stolen memory could return at campaign end; a bargain may be binding forever.
## Overview
### What the Feywild is

- It’s a parallel plane to the Material: roughly the same “map” (forests, mountains, seas in similar places) but turned up to 11 – more vivid, more magical, more dangerous.
- It’s fueled by emotion and wild magic. Strong feelings, oaths, and stories have mechanical weight there – they can influence the environment or how Fey react.
- Sensations are amplified: colours brighter, sounds clearer, emotions stronger – but also shadows darker, fears sharper.
- Any time the party crosses from “leak” to “full Fey,” you can immediately dial up intensity: weather, colours, smells, how hard they laugh/cry.
### Core Themes

- **Beauty & Horror:** Gorgeous vistas with deeply unsettling details (perfect flowers growing from a corpse, music played by unseen hands). Nothing is just pretty or just scary; it’s both.
- **Deals & Promises Matter**: Fey love bargains, taboos, and clever wording. A casual “I swear” can count as a real oath with consequences. Gifts, hospitality, and names are often currency.
- **Whimsy over logic**: Things don’t happen because they’re efficient; they happen because they’re dramatic, ironic, or funny.

### Time, memory, and reality rules
- **Time is weird**. Days in the Feywild might equal hours, weeks, or years outside – or vice versa.
- **Memory is slippery.**  Leaving can blur, twist, or erase what happened there – especially bargains or traumas. 
- **Rules are local.**  In one domain, lies might physically choke you; in another, you can’t draw weapons in a ring of mushrooms without magic misfiring. Prismeer is explicitly a “domain of delight” fractured into three mini-realms (Hither/Thither/Yon), each with its own flavour and weird rules.

### Who lives there (and how they behave)
- **Fey creatures:** pixies, sprites, dryads, satyrs, hags, eladrin, etc. They’re tied to nature and mood, not alignment labels.
- **Archfey & courts:** powerful beings with domains and courts (Seelie/Unseelie, Zybilna in Prismeer, other local powers). They act more like fae monarchs from folklore than gods.
- **Domains of Delight:** little “mini-realms” ruled by archfey or similar, like Prismeer – think Feywild’s answer to Ravenloft’s Domains of Dread.
- **Important DM note:** Fey are not random monsters – they almost always want something (amusement, a story, a memory, a tiny favour, a soul, your favourite colour, etc.).
### Travelling between Material and Feywild
- **Fey crossings**: naturally thin spots in old forests, stone circles, reflections, etc., where you can slip between planes.
- **Constructed gates** / rituals: powerful magic items, circles, or events (like the Witchlight Carnival) can open deliberate paths.

## Witches Story
https://5e.tools/adventure.html#wbtw,-1
### OG lore
The main antagonists of this story are three hags who collectively form the [[Hourglass Coven]]. Using an artifact called [Iggwilv's Cauldron](https://5e.tools/items.html#iggwilv's%20cauldron_wbtw), the hags have trapped an archfey named Zybilna in temporal stasis and carved up her fey domain among them. This domain is called [[Prismeer]]. To enter it, the characters must first visit the [[Witchlight Carnival]], which travels across the Material Plane and appears on the characters' world once every eight years. The carnival owners are a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named [Mister Witch](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#mister%20witch_wbtw) and [Mister Light](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#mister%20light_wbtw), who can help or hinder the characters' efforts to reach Prismeer. One of the many novelties of this adventure is that the characters can accomplish their goals without resorting to violence—but only if they're clever. They can fight their way through the adventure as well, but the odds won't always be in their favor.

### **Kettlesteam tells her story in the voice she stole from Candlefoot:**
Many years ago, she made a fey pact with Zybilna, the archfey who rules the Feywild domain of Prismeer. Recently, Kettlesteam has become convinced something is amiss with her patron. As a warlock, she senses that Zybilna is no longer in touch with her—a very disconcerting thought!
Kettlesteam wants to question the carnival's owners about Prismeer, but they keep giving her the cold shoulder. She's sure they know more than they're letting on.
During her last visit, Kettlesteam overheard Witch and Light talking in their wagon. She repeats the conversation, using her Mimicry trait to imitate Light's agitated voice ("Someone is going to find out about this! They'll shut us down!") followed by Witch's calm yet firm reply ("We agreed to this pact. Our hands were forced but our eyes were open. We let the Hourglass Coven take what it wants, and in return, we stay in business. That is what you want, right?").
Kettlesteam is causing trouble in the carnival and refuses to stop until Witch and Light divulge what they know about Zybilna and Prismeer.
Due to the terms of her fey pact, Kettlesteam can't enter Prismeer. She urges the characters to find out what has happened to Zybilna.
### Iggwilv's Cauldron
Iggwilv crafted this wondrous cauldron with the help of her adoptive mother, the archfey Baba Yaga. The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid.

Attunement. Any Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature's speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in 3d8 days. Only a wish spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.

Three hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags.

Random Properties. Regardless of the form it takes, the cauldron has the following random properties:

1 minor beneficial property (determined by rolling on the Minor Beneficial Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide)
1 minor detrimental property (determined by rolling on the Minor Detrimental Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide)
Gold Cauldron. The gold cauldron has the following properties:

If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.

If wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn't consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.
When the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a scrying spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.
Dipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a broom of flying for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.
Iron Cauldron. The iron cauldron has the following properties:

You can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a swarm of bats that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn't been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.
If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.

Tying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a wand of polymorph with 3 charges. This wand can't recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again for 8 days.
If you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn's horn while reciting the poem called "The Witch Queen's Cauldron" (see the accompanying sidebar), all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, doesn't age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can't be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn's horn for 1 minute while reciting "The Witch Queen's Cauldron" ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn's horn.
Destroying the Cauldron. The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.

The destruction of Iggwilv's Cauldron causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the "Hag Covens" sidebar in the Monster Manual).

**Reconstructing the Cauldron.** If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a wish spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron's reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse.

**The Witch Queen's Cauldron**
As explained in the description of Iggwilv's Cauldron, the poem titled "The Witch Queen's Cauldron" is an incantation that hints at the time-freezing property of the artifact:
*“Eight cats perch atop eight dead attending*
*Eight lizards flee from eight rats scavenging*
*Eight toads climbing meet eight dead and falling*
*Eight snakes sneak under eight bats screaming*
*Eight eyes open, always dreaming*
*All on the cauldron that is ever seeming”*
