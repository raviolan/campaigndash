## Tihildur
### Push
Word reaches you that one of your father's private agents has been spotted in Saltmarsh, asking about "a half-elf with more charm than sense." If he finds you here, there will be questions you don't want to answer. With your aura it'll be hard to hide here much longer. 

### Rumor
A sailor you were flirting with let slip that a red character has been seen working as "muscle" for a local merchant consortium at nighttime. The sailor didn't say it outright, but heavily hinted that it must be Valkrath. 
"Funny," he said, "for someone so righteous to stand guard over devils in fine clothes."

## Valkrath
### Push
A grizzled mercenary in the tavern recognised the symbol you wear from your old clan. He told you, in a low voice, that he once escorted a red-eyed, soft-spoken man "He asked a lot of questions about foreign guests in Saltmarsh" the mercenary said.

### Rumor
That same mercenary, after a few more drinks, muttered that the same man bore a signet ring identical to one he's seen your sparkly friend.

## Nyx
### Push
Your patron has been… unusually loud. Whispered words curl at the edges of your thoughts: "The road beyond Saltmarsh is cracked. Through the cracks, treasure spills. Follow the cracks." Sleep has become almost impossible inside the town walls.

### Rumor
While staring into a tankard (or at nothing at all), you were certain you heard your patron say:

"The shadow one has made a bargain like yours before… and broke it. Debts like that echo."

There was no clarification, only a soft, amused chuckle and the sensation of feathers brushing your neck whenever Tenebris walked by.

## Oceanus
### Push
A formal letter arrived from a distant sea-elf cousin serving as an envoy inland. He writes of strange storms, disappearing envoys, and begs for capable help. If the storms spread, they may threaten the seas and the noble house you once served.

### Rumor
A human trader, nervous around you but eager to gossip, swore he'd seen wanted posters in another port for "a halfling barbarian who wrecked a noble's manor in a fit of passion." The sketch looked… suspiciously like Odo, but with nicer clothes.
The trader added, "They say he left behind a trail of broken furniture and broken hearts."

## Odo
### Push
The innkeeper (Hanna Rist) takes notice of you and says "Up the Old King's Road there's a tavern with stories so scandalous they keep them in locked books. Also, they pay well for strong arms. I've never been there myself, but the stories are marvellous" 

### Rumor
A drunk in the corner told you, conspiratorially, that Nyx once stole something so valuable from a thieves' guild that they put a price on her head — and on anyone who travels with her.
They claimed she has a secret stash of jewels "worth a small kingdom" hidden somewhere on her person, and that her "imaginary voices" are actually sent by the guild to torment her.

## Tenebris
### Push
For three nights straight, you've woken to the sound of crows cawing—yet when you look outside, there are none. This morning, a single black feather lay on your windowsill.

### Rumor
During a quiet moment in tavern the night before, a nervous acolyte confided that one of the sea elves in town is "touched by doom."
"I had a vision," they whisper. "A noble sea-elf drowning under a sky full of crows. Everyone around him survived… only because he didn't." The acolyte looked at you, then at Oceanus, and quickly pretended they'd said nothing.
