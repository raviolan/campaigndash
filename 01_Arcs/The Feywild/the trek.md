### The Storm
Recently, [[Saltmarsh]] are being hit by a wrong-feeling storm. Lightning in strange colors, thunder like distant voices. Its almost as if the storm is looking for something.
#### DM Truth 
- The [[Feywild]] leak is not a [[Feywild]] plan. It is a scar.
- The world/nature, strained by mortal meddling with old ward-stones and deep magic, unleashed a once-in-a-century storm.
- That storm chose [[Tihildur]] as its lightning rod, awakening his storm sorcerer powers.
- The space-time plane stuff is already thin because of the [[Aurumvorax]] summoning 
- The nearest plane "under pressure" was the [[Feywild]], so its energy now seeps through the crack.  
- Hags/Fey are **opportunists**, not the original cause.

After the storm:
Dead fish wash up humming half-remembered songs.
Lanterns flicker with foxfire.
Children dream of talking animals
Dead birds everywhere, including crows

**Possibly?:**
That shock has splintered reality near some old giant ward-stones, opening cracks where the [[Feywild]] leaks through ([[Witchlight Carnival]]).

## [[Nyx]] and [[Captain Xendros]]
Nyx. You’ve kept me waiting long enough.  
Bring the others.
— X.

Först: min lilla djävul försvinner på hemliga uppdrag för Cognoscenti Esoterica, skämmer ut en hel liga tjuvar, och kommer tillbaka utan att ens bjuda mig på vin.

Den där tavlan du ‘hämtade’… den har inte kommit fram dit den skulle.
Vad hände med Constantoris mästerverk? 
Tavlan är en Nyckel till fler mysterier än vad de flesta förstår. 
Och nycklar säljer man inte.
Nycklar använder man.
Vi kan göra det rätta, ge tavlan tillbaka. Vi kan sälja den och tjäna en förmögenhet.
Eller så låter vi dom jaga skuggor medan du går före. Jag är mycket nöjd med din insats, lilla Djävul. 

For now, gå norrut. The road will shake loose the answers I want. I’ll find you when I need you . Ni andra ser till att hon kommer fram hel. 

Xendros lämnar fram ett brev till Nyx:

**To my troublesome little devil,**

By now you should be somewhere the sea no longer smells like home. Good.
The storm that brushed [[Saltmarsh]] was not a local matter. When waves climb that high, even my superiors look up from their ledgers.

You are not on vacation. You are walking a crack in the world.

Along that crack are three things I care about:
– Whoever armed [[Sanbalet]].
– Whoever wants [[Constantori's painting]] more than I do.
– Whoever taught the sky to whisper.

You will meet people who pretend not to know those names. Some serve the Cognoscenti Esoterica. Some serve their own fear. Some serve no one at all. Listen anyway.

If a woman offers you tea before she offers you her name, give her the enclosed token and this phrase:
“Whispers outbid facts.”

She will either help you or try to kill you. Both outcomes interest me.
I will not write again soon. Paper burns.
But when the road has given you a name – one true name behind all this fumbling – I expect to hear it, one way or another.

Walk in other people’s blind spots.
– Captain Xendros

P.S. If  <font color="#245bdb">Tihildur</font> starts hearing the sky, don’t let him face it alone. Storms love a diva.

## Scene A: Roadside inspection / petty checkpoint 
On the Old King’s Road, a pompous minor official and a handful of guards stop caravans “for taxes and safety inspections.” They’re corrupt but not evil. It's an excuse to tax, bully, and shake down travellers.

**Scene setup (what the party sees)**
A makeshift checkpoint on the road:
A wooden barrier or chain across the way.
A tent or small shack.
A handful of bored-but-armed guards.
A minor official or scribe, clearly in charge:
Well-fed, ink-stained, maybe wearing a badge or sash of some local authority.
A couple of carts ahead or behind in line to show this is “normal” for locals.
The official announces something like:
“Routine inspection.”
“New road toll.”
“Checking for contraband after the storm.”
Keep it vague but mildly annoying.

The ledger
A bound ledger on a small table, half open. it's labeled *Bribe Ledger.*

The official’s attitude
Starts as officious and condescending.
Can be:
Intimidated,
Charmed,
Bribed,
Bored into letting them through.

The guards
Mostly just doing a job, not zealots.
Can be:
Distracted (conversation, boasting, games),
Pulled aside for “help” with gear or mounts,
Turned sympathetic (“we’re on important business”).

They meet one of the Aroom brothers from the market.

Drop tiny Witchlight hints. A few options; you only need 1–2:

a) The ledger clue (good for Nyx)
In the bribe ledger or notes Nyx can steal/see, include an entry like:
A line where some group refused to pay the toll and the guards got nothing:
“Entry: ‘Travelling show – refused payment, left no footprints after gate. Jack-o’-lantern sigil.’”
Or just an initialism like “WLC” with a question mark.

A note from the annoyed official:
“No more dealing with those people, they gave us fake coin that turned into butterflies.”
Nyx might share this or keep it to herself, but later, Burly or Kettlesteam can confirm “that was the Witchlight lot.”

b) Physical leftover
Near the checkpoint:
A splintered tent peg painted in carnival colors,
A ticket stub with a stylized jack-o’-lantern or dragonfly on it,
A patch of ground with faint multicolored glitter that doesn’t wash off.
If someone investigates magically, it pings as weak Fey magic.

c) NPC gossip
A traveller or guard can mention
“A few days ago a troop of performers came through. Colors too bright, smiles too wide. Their wagons didn’t creak. Hated them.”
You don’t need to say “Witchlight Carnival” yet. Just make it feel like something odd passed this way.
##  <font color="#245bdb">Tihildur</font>’s Call Lightning – the Storm Performance
On the road, they approach a shattered stone milepost. The clouds gather unnaturally overhead. Static builds; everyone’s hair rises.

 <font color="#245bdb">Tihildur</font> feels the storm take notice of him. If he chooses to answer, he knows instinctively it will require a performance – a declaration – and it will hurt.
 <font color="#245bdb">Tihildur</font> hears (in his head, or as a rumble only he understands):
*“Sing, little storm. Or go back to shadows of other men’s names.”*
Put on a show unlike any other. Right now. Make the storm find you. It will give you its power… if you accept its mark. To seal it, the lightning must strike you. You can flinch, or you can stand.

**Mechanically you can:**
Have him make a Con save.
On a success: he drops to low HP but stays conscious, crackling with energy.
On a failure: he’s blasted unconscious at 0 HP, but stable.

**Either way, describe:**
Clothing scorched, hair singed with a new white streak,
The smell of ozone, and the milepost now blackened.

To seal the deal,  <font color="#245bdb">Tihildur</font> must sacrifice something from his old life. An item in your inventory turns to ash. **OR** Every time he casts Call Lightning, his father’s diviners have a faint chance of sensing it – the storm is tying their bloodlines together.

## The Bent Willow Tavern
Not actually a porn club, which Odo might think

When the party arrives, the tavern is busy with normal folk plus these :
###### Old druid / hermit:
Sky-spear chose you, boy. And when sky-spear falls on broken stone… the world splits.

###### Ellywick Trumblestrum
- Ellywick’s lute strings whisper secrets when plucked; they told her:
    - A _storm-marked noble_,
    - A _shadow-haunted wanderer_,
    - A _thief of keys_,
    - And one _claimed by the sea_  
        will “walk a crack in the world” and pass through this tavern.
        
- She knows:
       - Prismeer is broken and something is very wrong there.  
    - The PCs’ fates are entangled with Prismeer and the leak.
    - The Bent Willow mirror is a **thin place**, and she’s studying it musically     
- She does **not** know the exact cause of the leak, and she’s careful about naming Prismeer/Zybilna/hags out loud – loose words attract attention

**Why she’s in the tavern**
- She’s “on tour” but really she’s
    - Testing the air around the mirror with music.
    - Waiting to see if the people from her visions actually show up.
- Secondary motive: she wants interesting stories and songs; PCs are walking plot hooks.

**What she can say (tiers & checks)**
- Baseline, no check:
    - Offhand comments about the storm, strange vibes, and how the tavern “sits on an echo.”
- If a PC **performs with her, tips well, or chats kindly** → DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion / Performance):
    - She hints that “this place is closer to somewhere else than it looks” and that they “carry other skies with them.”
- If someone really digs (DC 15 Insight or Persuasion, and she feels safe):
    - She admits she came here “because the strings said your story matters to a broken land I once visited” – but keeps names vague.

*<font color="#e36c09">“Oh good, new faces. The regulars only have so many bad decisions for me to sing about.”*</font>

<font color="#e36c09">*“The storm didn’t just hit this place, you know. It noticed it. Places like this… they’re nearer to elsewhere than they look.”*</font>

<font color="#e36c09">*“My strings don’t hum for every drunk with a sword. They hum for people like you. People who’ve already stepped on cracks in the world, whether they meant to or not.”</font>*
###### Diana Cloppington. 
Diana made a bargain with Skabatha Nightshade to be reunited with her warhorse; the hag fused her with the horse.
She cannot speak or write about:
Hourglass Coven
Zybilna
Prismeer’s true current state.

Attempts produce:
Sap coughs, or Mushrooms blistering on her fingers until she stops.

She knows exactly what’s happening with the leak, but is magically gagged.

**Why she’s in the tavern**

She’s travelling with a caravan as guard / “special attraction.”
She feels a pull towards our realm – it feels like home, but wrong. She’s trying to decide whether to risk going through anything that looks like a gateway.

Secretly hoping to find a powerful mage/cleric who might break or tweak the bargain. 
**What she can say (and how to reveal the curse)**
Baseline:
- She tells people she’s “a human who made a bad deal” and avoids questions.
- If PCs push with concern rather than prying (DC 13 Insight to notice pain / deflection):
- They see sap/mushrooms when she tries to explain more.

Arcana or Religion DC 14:
- Identify this as hag-level curse / geas-ish pact.
- If they gain her trust (heal her, defend her, show kindness)
- She might ask them: “If you ever find a way into a land of masks and moons and mangled bargains… remember me.”

Sample lines
At the bar, casual:
“It’s Diana. Not ‘horse-lady’. Not ‘centaur’. Diana. I made a bad deal. That’s all.”

Trying to warn them indirectly about the mirror:
“Don’t stare into that glass too long. It looks back. I know what it’s like, feeling a place tug on your bones.”

When the curse kicks in (you can describe sap/mushrooms):
“I once served a… a… khh—” (coughs, wipes at mouth) “Sorry. Some names won’t leave my throat anymore.”

###### Goblin wrestling might happen in the tavern

A Small participant has to pin an unarmed goblin (lawful good), while a Medium participant has to pin one goblin while wrestling two of them. Winning the game requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check contested by the goblin; two goblins working together make one check with advantage. Resolve a tie by rerolling. A victorious participant earns one roll on the Carnival Prizes table.

###### Lysa "ledger" Feld - nervous half-elf barmaid / bookkeeper
- **Front**: shy, good with numbers, runs tabs for locals.
- **Truth**: she keeps a second set of books for Brotherhood/Cyrieth jobs; can hint that “the man you seek likes to be paid in secrets, not coin.”
- **Hook**: If the party protects her from rowdy smugglers or pays well, she’ll reveal that Cyrieth’s people meet in the Bent Willow once a tenday.
- **Attitude**: Starts Indifferent. Becomes Friendly if:
	- PCs help her with rowdy patrons
	- Or overpay for drinks / tip generously
	- Or show kindness when she’s clearly stressed.
- **Revealing information** (layered):
1. **General shadiness (easy)**
    - Trigger: casual chat + DC **11 Persuasion** or a kind gesture.
    - She admits: “Some customers are… better left unmentioned,” and hints the tavern attracts “important” but dangerous patrons.
        
2. **Brotherhood/coded meetings (medium)**
    - Trigger: target her with pointed questions about symbols / strange guests + DC **13 Persuasion** _or_ show her you spotted the scarlet knot / red cord.
    - She reveals: “Certain people meet here once a tenday; we hang the red cord when they’ve booked the private room.”
        
3. **Cyrieth link (hard)**
    - Trigger: promise of protection + solid trust, or 5–10 gp bribe + DC **15 Persuasion / Insight** to reassure her.
    - She quietly mentions a **man who pays in secrets**, never the same face twice, who “likes to let others think they hired him, but he’s always the one making the list.”
    - You can have her use an alias (“The Serpent” or “Master Nerol”) long before she says “Cyrieth”.'

 **Sample lines**
Busy-night greeting:

> “Evening. If you’re drinking on credit, I need a name. And one you’ll remember in the morning, please.”

Deflecting questions:

> “Some folk pay in coin, some in gossip. Some in the kind of secrets that get people nailed to doors. I prefer coin.”

Opening up a bit:

> “When the red cord’s up, we don’t ask who they are. We just keep the ale flowing and make sure no one hears them over the music.”
###### Brother Calem 
**Role**
- Soft-spoken traveling preacher; outwardly harmless, inwardly **Scarlet Brotherhood recruiter**.
- Uses the tavern to:
    - Sound out locals’ resentment (against outsiders, council, lizardfolk, dwarves, etc.).
    - Identify angry, fearful, or ambitious people for the Brotherhood to groom.

**Recruitment method**
- Sits with individuals or small groups, buys a round, and starts with gentle questions:
    - “Do you feel safe with all these changes?”
    - “Do you ever think Saltmarsh should be run by its own, not by strangers?”
- If someone responds with prejudice / xenophobia / “strong-man” fantasies:
    - He invites them to a **“discussion circle”** after closing, or on a specific night when the red cord is up.
- Mechanics:
    - Insight DC **12** lets PCs realise he’s steering people toward divisive topics.
    - Religion DC **13** might notice his “faith” is oddly doctrine-light and ideology-heavy.

**Charms he sells**
Mostly useless trinkets that double as **subtle markers** for recruits:
- Prices: 1–5 gp each; expensive for what they are.
- Examples (no inherent magic unless you _want_ a small perk):
    1. Red-thread **wrist charm** with a knot pattern (Brotherhood symbol).
    2. Tiny bone token etched with an eye.
    3. Simple brass ring with a red enamel line.
    4. Wooden disk painted half white, half red.
    5. A folded scrap of parchment with a “blessing” (ominous proverb).
    6. A small **iron nail** wrapped with red thread.

By default, they’re flavor only. 

**What to do with coded phrases (Brotherhood)**
- Calem might teach new recruits a **phrase** to prove themselves, e.g.: 
    - “The hand that bleeds must guide the world.”
- Saying this to the right NPC (e.g. Lysa, another marked patron) + showing a red-thread charm:
    - Gets them admitted to a meeting,
    - Or gets them sent to a specific contact in another town.

You can use this alongside the “Willow Ale” outhouse code:
- Recruits learn both the **physical code** (where to go, what to order) and the **verbal code** (what to say once inside).

**Sample lines**
Opening spiel at a table:

> “Storms remind us we’re small. But some of us were born to be more than driftwood on the tide, don’t you think?”

Selling a charm:

> “A token of protection. Not from the gods – from other people. Those who wear this find themselves among… likeminded friends.”

To a PC he suspects might be recruitable:

> “If you ever feel Saltmarsh belongs to you more than to them… come back another night. I’ll show you you’re not alone.”
###### Garrick of the Red Sails
**Role**
- Retired smuggler with a limp; drinks too much, talks too loud.
- Used to haul cargo for **Salabaster-adjacent jobs** and other black-market players.
- He’s brushed up against Cyrieth’s operations but never high enough to see the full picture.

**What he knows**
- There’s a **fixer** who:
    - Never used the same name twice,
    - Paid in secrets and blackmail material,
    - Used scarlet-marked crates and wax seals.
        
- He remembers _one_ job moving “red bundles upriver” that went bad (perfect to tie to Sanbalet, Salabaster scandals, or ward-stone meddling).
- He once transported a young noble (Tihildur?) or noble’s baggage and recognised the family sigil coinciding with one of these jobs – hinting at tangled family business.

**Mechanics**
- Starts drunk and chatty but vague.
- Information layers:
    
    1. Buy him drinks / listen to stories → he talks about “the old days” in general.        
    2. DC **12 Persuasion** (or just let it happen after a few drinks): he mentions the mysterious fixer and the red-sealed crates.        
    3. DC **14 Persuasion or Intimidation** to get specific: names like “The Serpent”, “The Man With Many Names”, or detailed description that clearly matches Cyrieth.
        
- If they push too hard with threats, he clams up or bolts.

**Sample lines**
Rambling story opener:

> “You don’t know rough seas until you’ve tried steering a hold full of stolen brandy past a sahuagin hunting pack, let me tell you…”

Hinting at Cyrieth:

> “Most folk pay with coin. This one? Paid with letters. ‘Deliver this, and if anyone stops you, show them page three and they’ll suddenly forget the rules.’ I didn’t ask who wrote them.”

Dropping a red connection:

> “Funny thing, though. Every crate for him had a little scarlet knot in the corner. Like that one, under your table there. Huh. Brings back memories…”



###### Hidden Symbols in the tavern:
- Tiny scarlet knot carved under certain tables / on chair legs – Brotherhood sign. *(Perception 13 while sitting/leaning/searching)*
	- “You spot a tiny knot carved underneath, stained a faint dull red, like old wine or dried blood.”
- A faded red cord wrapped around one of the rafters above the bar: marked meeting spot. *(perception 12)*
	- Above the bar someone has wrapped a thin red cord around a beam. It looks decorative… but it’s the only one.”
- On the back of the outhouse door: chalk mark that looks like decorative swirls, but to someone with thieves’ cant it reads: “SAFE HOUSE – ASK FOR WILLOW ALE.”
	- Without thieves’ cant, you can allow DC **15 Intelligence (Investigation)** + relevant background (criminal, sailor, smuggler) to intuit “this is code, not art,” but not the exact meaning.
	#### How to use the note: 
	If a PC goes to the bar and says something like “A Willow Ale, please” in a knowing way, have the staff react:
	- - f they’re clearly shady / accompanied by a known contact:
        - Lysa or the barkeep might say: “Back room’s full. Take the third door on the left, knock twice then once.”
            
    - If they look suspiciously _not_ underworld:
        - The staff plays dumb: “We don’t serve that here.”
        - OR asks a follow-up test question: “Who told you about Willow Ale?” → require DC 13 Deception to bluff.

Treat it as a **doorway into Brotherhood/Cyrieth’s network** – a way to accidentally trip into a meeting, or deliberately use it once they figure it out.
###### After Tavern

<font color="#ff0000">Somehow they find out that the Feywild has been leaking into this world</font>. Possibly by looking through a mirror, which for some reason is glitching. 
https://5e.tools/adventure.html#wbtw,-1,through%20the%20looking%20glass,0

- The surface ripples like water or shows a wrong reflection
- Mirrors glitching
- planar boundary thinning
- Diana is your strongest confirmation, but she’s gagged by her bargain. She knows exactly what’s happening.

**Bavlorna Blightstraw's** thief is one of her lornlings**—a miniature version of herself**. Use the quickling stat block in appendix C to represent this toad-like creature.

**Skabatha Nightshade's thief is Sowpig, a Small ghoul** with 17 (5d6) hit points. She appears as a little, gray-skinned girl wearing a pig mask and holding an oversized lollipop.

**Endelyn Moongrave's thief is the detached shadow of Gleam,** a high elf acrobat who wears a crescent moon mask.
