#### Current events
##### Who Knows What (Dawn Incarnate / Golden Beast)
– Common folk: a hazy tale of a **golden beast that eats greed**; children’s story.  
– Saltmarsh council & dwarves: assume it’s myth; no practical knowledge.  
– Lizardfolk spiritual leaders: believe there was once a **sacred guardian** bound to the land/sea balance, now “sleeping or cursed”.  
– Sahuagin priests: they know more, but only that such a thing existed and that keeping it dormant suits their purposes.  
– Esoteric scholars / Stone Library: dusty records hint at a “Dawn Incarnate” tied to this coast, but nothing actionable without serious research.  
– Xendros/Cyrieth: vague rumours of a **buried source of power** in the region; they’re sniffing around but don’t grasp the full picture.
#### History and Lore
##### How Was the Dawn Incarnate for Saltmarsh Originally Weakened?
- The Dawn Incarnate for Saltmarsh (let’s call it the Emerald Heart) was originally tied to the lizardfolk's spirituality and their role as Speakers of the Ancestors. Its power sustained their community and ensured their cultural and political influence in the Radiant Citadel.
- Disruption Event: During a time of economic expansion, early human settlers in Saltmarsh, seeking fertile land and sea routes, encroached on lizardfolk territory. The conflict led to skirmishes that damaged the temple housing the Emerald Heart. The disruption caused the Dawn Incarnate to weaken, losing its connection to the Radiant Citadel.
- During the early human-lizardfolk tensions, a renegade scholar (connected to the Candlekeep lore) stole knowledge about the Emerald Heart's rituals and essence, hiding it in the extra-dimensional library.
- The book in the library holds the final piece of knowledge needed to restore the Emerald Heart: the ritual to cleanse and reactivate the Seed of Renewal.
- The scholar may have originally intended to weaponize this knowledge for personal gain but disappeared before acting on it.

##### Sahuagin
- Want to dominate coastal regions through terror and disruption.
- Know that the Dawn Incarnate's memory is dangerous — restoring it could open a gateway to the Radiant Citadel and draw in powerful outsiders.
- Use aurumvorax propaganda + corrupted magic to prevent that return.
- Enlisted Kedjou to make the Dawn Incarnate monstrous and reinforce fear.
#####  Lizardfolk
- Remember the true nature of the aurumvorax as a sacred, protective force.
- Would not oppose its return, and might support it if they knew it was possible.
- Were forced from their island home, now a corrupted stronghold for the sahuagin.
#### The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh (GoS):
* A classic Saltmarsh mystery introducing smugglers, the Scarlet Brotherhood, and subtle traces of Salabaster Shipping involvement. Integrate Salabaster Shipping and subtle Cyrieth connections through logs or notes.
*  Place Cyrieth’s name as a whispered rumor among the smugglers, hinting at his role as "The Serpent."
* Sanbalet’s gang and the Sea Ghost are a direct tie to Nyx’s black-market quest.

#### Danger at Dunwater (GoS)
- Lizardfolk weapon trade reflects larger political dynamics.
    - Use the lizardfolk weapon trade to reflect larger political dynamics, tying the Dawn Incarnate’s corruption to the sahuagin threat.

#### Gold for Fools and Princes (JttRC)
A tunnel collapse traps miners deep within the Goldwarren. But even more concerning, a survivor of the disaster reports being attacked by a creature thought to be long extinct. 
Odo: The defense of Saltmarsh’s militia ties directly to his history with Tom and Will Stoutly.

#### Aurumvorax and Kedjou
**The Aurumvorax:**
		- a legendary predator known to devour precious metals, once thought extinct in the region. Only told about in dwarf drinking stories or cautionary tales for greedy prospectors.
		- Either extinct for generations, *or* a mythical creature. Nobody is really sure. 
		- the wizard Kedjou summoned/recreated the spirit of the aurumvoraxes to cause chaos
		- *(Originally from the Radiant Citadel, Gold for fools and princes)*

**Kedjou the exiled wizard/corrupt priest (neutral evil)
- An exiled mage obsessed with returning “deep-earth beings” to the surface. Has been experimenting with conjuration and ancient runes.
  
- Officially titled Arcane Integration Advisor to the Guildhall of Earth and Flame. In truth, he's a conjuration specialist brought in by Citadel interests to explore magical applications for mining efficiency—and secretly works with Kirana to destabilize Copperlocks’ hold on the Goldwarren.
  
- Kedjou created the aurumvorax magic on behalf of the Sahuagin. Kedjous motivations is that he wants bigger influence and stronger connections to the Capital, and saw the opportunity to team up with Kirina (from Gold for Fools and Princes), while he had a lethal weapon that had to be tested anyway (the weapon being the aurumvorax magic). 
- The Lizardfolk are not opposed to the aurumvorax (correct?), because in the ancient times it was a very peaceful creature (the Dawn Incarnate Guardian of Saltmarsh was the Aurumvorax). 
- Now in recent times, the aurumvorax's memory has been tainted by forces who want the dawn incarnate to remain dead, because that's the most secure way to keep the portal to the Capital (the Radiant Citadel) closed. 
- By tainting history and the commonpeoples' memories and stories of the aurumvoraxes, they can rest assured that nobody will try to bring them back. Until now, that is. 
- The Sahuagin saw the impact that the aurumvorax propaganda has had, and enlisted Kedjou to help them. Together, they managed to bring a new, nightmare version of the Aurumvorax to life. This way, the Sahuagin hope to remain (and gain more) control in the realm, while Kedjou (a sly opportunist) wants to piggyback off of their influence, and eventually execute dark and evil plans of his own (undisclosed).

His research focuses on summoning and binding extraplanar creatures to aid in excavation, protection... or sabotage.
He’s manipulative, calculating, and considers most non-mages beneath him.

#### Saltmarsh and [[Tihildur]] / Salabaster Shipping 
- Saltmarsh’s economy relies on the Salabaster Shipping Company, though Tihildur is unaware of the full extent of its black market dealings.
- The Scarlet Brotherhood has reasons to target Tihildur’s family due to their marriage and business alliance undermining the Suloise noble house.
- Subtle clues to Salabaster Shipping’s involvement will appear in The Sinister  Secret of Saltmarsh.

#### Saltmarsh and [[Nyx]]
Captain Xendros will give Nyx a personal side quest to retrieve the Journal of Kwalish, rumored to contain schematics and magical knowledge.
Nyx’s criminal background and connections with Xendros provide unique leverage in the black market, allowing her to uncover hidden lore and acquire magical items.


### Deep lore recap 

#### Key takeaways

- The conflict is rooted in the manipulation of history: tainting the Dawn Incarnate’s memory allowed the sahuagin to maintain control.
    
- Kedjou is an opportunistic villain whose creation of the Nightmare Aurumvorax serves both the sahuagin’s objectives and his own hidden schemes.
    
- The lizardfolk represent a potential ally for the heroes; their knowledge of the aurumvorax’s true nature could be crucial in countering sahuagin propaganda and restoring the Dawn Incarnate.
### Origins of the Aurumvorax and Dawn Incarnate

- In ancient times, Saltmarsh was protected by a **Dawn Incarnate** spirit that took the form of a **peaceful aurumvorax**.
    
- Over the centuries, unnamed forces distorted the aurumvorax’s reputation to keep the **portal to the Radiant Citadel** sealed. By turning public memory of the creature into something monstrous, they ensured no one would attempt to revive it

#### Kedjou’s involvement
Kedjou is a mage‑for‑hire with hidden ambitions. He allied with the sahuagin and experimented with aurumvorax magic as a way to gain influence with the Capital.

Viewing the sahuagin alliance as a testbed, Kedjou helped them create a Nightmare Aurumvorax, a twisted version of the Dawn Incarnate. This nightmare creature serves the sahuagin’s plans but also allows Kedjou to advance his own dark goals

#### Sahaugin agenda
- The sahuagin want to **dominate coastal regions** through terror and disruption. They see the lingering memory of the Dawn Incarnate as a threat, because restoring it might open a route to the Radiant Citadel and invite powerful settlers who could challenge their power.
    
- To prevent that, they spread **aurumvorax propaganda** and use Kedjou’s corrupted magic to ensure the Dawn Incarnate is remembered only as a monster. By enlisting Kedjou, they transformed the guardian into the Nightmare Aurumvorax to reinforce fear

#### Lizardfolk perspective

- The lizardfolk remember the aurumvorax’s **true, sacred role** as a protector. They were driven from their island home, which is now a sahuagin‑corrupted stronghold.
    
- Unlike the sahuagin, they **would support the Dawn Incarnate’s return** if it meant reclaiming their homeland and restoring balance
