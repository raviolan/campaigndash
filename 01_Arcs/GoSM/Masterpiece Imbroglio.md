#sideQuest

### Overall summary
“Masterpiece Imbroglio” sets up an art‑heist‑style sidequest. The eccentric **Cognoscenti Esoterica** lost a coveted painting to the professional Agile Hand thieves’ guild and asks the heroes to steal it back discreetly. Nyx’s personal history with the guild, Dusk’s vendetta over a mysterious artifact, and Tihildur’s wary interest in the collectors provide character‑driven hooks. The suggested adventure hooks (favor owed, knowledge sought, strike a blow) give you multiple narrative reasons to involve the party, while the details about the Cognoscenti Esoterica and Agile Hand flesh out the lore behind the mission.

### Cognoscenti Esoterica
- **Nature of the group:** A quirky society of collectors, scholars and conspiracy‑minded oddballs. They crave rare artifacts and occult curios but aren’t professional criminals. Picture an eccentric “Secret Society of Fringe Historians meets Occult Antique Roadshow.” Academics mock them, yet they sometimes stumble on genuine magical treasures (such as Constantori’s Portrait)
  
- **Reputation:** Their gaudy branding makes nobles like laugh, but he knows they have deep pockets and obsess over relics others deem too dangerous. He’s heard that they even tried to buy a banshee’s comb from a Raven Queen shrine. To him, they’re foolish yet potentially dangerous because their wealth lets them out‑bid nobles and chase risky magic

### Nyx & the Agile Hand
- **Possible connection:** Nyx Hellfire once brushed up against the Agile Hand, an elite thieves’ guild that treats theft as a profession. She was invited to join after lifting a cursed bracelet but ghosted them when she discovered how cold‑blooded and joyless their methods were. This gives her a reason to recognize their calling cards and feel conflicted if she encounters their fence or rival crew. It also adds tension, since the guild may remember her as “the one who dipped”

### Dusk’s grievance
- **Threat to Nyx:** A note suggests that the character Dusk no longer cares about the stolen painting itself. Instead, he wants answers or revenge, feeling that Nyx cost him a “kingmaker.” He mentions that “The Archivist called it the Key to the Stone Library” and threatens her with, “You stole from the wrong shadows, girl … I just need your ashes.” This provides a darker, personal stake for Nyx and hints at a larger plot surrounding a mysterious ring and a “Stone Library”

### Sidequest hook – Adrisa’s letter
- **Mission offer:** A formal letter from **Adrisa Carimorte**, Curator‑Adjunct of the Cognoscenti Esoterica, invites the party to retrieve **Constantori’s Portrait**, a painting of both artistic and occult significance that the Agile Hand stole. Because official channels would risk scandal, she seeks adventurers with “nimble minds, steady hands, and a disregard for petty legality.” She offers discretion and promises arrangements at a secure location
