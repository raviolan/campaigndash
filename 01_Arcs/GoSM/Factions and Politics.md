### [[Scarlet Brotherhood]]  
The [[Scarlet Brotherhood]] is a secretive faction seeking to restore the Suloise noble houses to power.  

#### Feywild version
**Core idea**
- Secret society of fanatics who believe:
    - Their blood/people (“Suel” in canon) are destined to rule.
    - Everyone else is a tool, shield, or stepping stone.
        
- Methods:
    - Infiltration, blackmail, assassination, quiet coups.
    - Use local resentment and fear to turn towns against “outsiders”.

**In [[Saltmarsh]] region (your version)**
- Goals:
    - Destabilise the coast so they can grab power and influence.
    - Control key trade routes and magical assets (ward-stones, leaks, artifacts).
        
- Tactics:
	- Embed agents in: 
        - Council-adjacent roles,
		- Smuggling rings, 
        - Road officials (e.g., checkpoint Aroom brother),
        - Taverns like the [[Bent Willow Tavern]].
            
    - Stir up:
        - Hate for [[Lizardfolk]] & dwarves,
        - Suspicion of [[Radiant Citadel]]/foreigners,
        - “Strong leader” sentiment.

**[[Cyrieth Nerolien]]'s relationship with them**

- He’s a **fixer / broker** they use when subtlety and deniability matter.
- He:
    - Helps weaken old protections (ward-stones, certain rituals, key people) to make the region unstable.
    - Connects [[Scarlet Brotherhood]] money to local criminals and mercenaries, then disappears before things blow up.
- They don’t fully trust him; he doesn’t fully trust them. But he profits from their chaos.
    

**Table flavor**
 - Visuals: scarlet cords, red-thread charms, small red knots carved in wood.
- Phrases: “order,” “purity,” “proper rule,” “our own kind in charge.”
- Use them as **shadowy pressure**, not necessarily the Big Boss – perfect mid-tier antagonists and connective tissue.
