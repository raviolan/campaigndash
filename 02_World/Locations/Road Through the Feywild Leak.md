Connected to: [[Old King's Road]], [[Feywild Summary]], [[the trek]], [[Bent Willow Tavern]]

Extension of the [[Old King's Road]] where reality bleeds into the [[Feywild]] due to storm damage and ward-stone manipulation.

## The Storm Scar
- Created when [[Tihildur]]'s storm awakening damaged ancient ward-stones
- **Not planned by Fey** - this is a wound in reality, not an invasion
- [[Scarlet Brotherhood]] and [[Cyrieth Nerolien]] were manipulating ward-stones before the storm hit
- Space-time barrier already weakened by [[Aurumvorax]] summoning ([[Kedjou]]'s work)

## Feywild Bleed Effects
- Dead fish wash up humming half-remembered songs
- Lanterns flicker with foxfire
- Children dream of talking animals
- Dead birds everywhere (affecting [[Tenebris]] with crow paranoia)
- Reality "wrong" - trees whisper, rivers flow uphill, impossible moon reflections

## Journey Progression
**Route**: [[Saltmarsh]] → [[Old King's Road]] → [[Bent Willow Tavern]] → **Feywild Leak Area** → Full [[Feywild]] crossing

**Key Checkpoints:**
- [[Bent Willow Tavern]] - Last "normal" stopping point before reality gets strange
- Glitching mirror at tavern shows visible Feywild influence
- Beyond tavern: increasing reality distortions and [[Feywild]] encounters

## Strategic Importance
- **[[Captain Xendros]]'s Investigation**: Nyx tasked to find who "taught the sky to whisper"
- **[[Scarlet Brotherhood]] Operations**: Using instability for their agenda  
- **Personal Stakes**: [[Tihildur]]'s guilt over causing the crack, [[Tenebris]]'s crow fears intensified
