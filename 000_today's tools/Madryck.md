In this preamble, an aging warlock named **Madryck Roslof** tells the characters (those not working at the Witchlight Carnival) about a faerie realm called Prismeer, which can be reached only by finding and using a fey crossing in the carnival. Madryck says that his archfey patron, **Zybilna**, rules Prismeer. He begs the characters to journey to this domain and find out what has happened to Zybilna, with whom he has lost contact.

"I've acquired many treasures and made important contacts during my lengthy adventuring career," says Madryck. "I would like to pass the treasures I possess and the favors I am owed to you. In exchange, I ask that you travel to Prismeer, a domain in the Feywild, and find out what fate has befallen the archfey that rules it. This archfey, Zybilna, is my patron and inspiration—the source of my power.

"I have been unable to contact Zybilna for the better part of a year, and I fear something terrible has happened. My adventuring days are over, but Zybilna has been good to me, and I would like to know she is well before I take my leave.

"Every eight years, our world is visited by a traveling extravaganza called the Witchlight Carnival. It recently returned and is camped three days' travel from here. I'm asking you now because this carnival might pack up and leave in a week or two, and it contains your only route to Prismeer—a fey crossing, if you will.

"Seek out Zybilna of Prismeer, help her if you can, and return with proof that she is alive and well. Upon your return, all the hard-won earnings of my adventuring career shall be yours."

## What Madryck knows
If the characters request more information about the Witchlight Carnival, Madryck says that he hasn't visited the carnival in sixty-four years and admits that a lot can change in that time. He advises the characters to explore the carnival thoroughly on their own. He doesn't presume to know what form the fey crossing currently takes or how well hidden and protected it is. He does provide the following reliable information:

- Zybilna is a fairy godmother to mortals. She created the carnival as a means by which mortals could enter her realm and beseech her aid.
- When Madryck last visited the carnival, it was run by a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named [Mister Witch](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#mister%20witch_wbtw) and [Mister Light](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#mister%20light_wbtw). He assumes they're still in charge.
- Madryck dimly recalls that Witch and Light acquired the carnival more than a hundred years ago from an eladrin (an elf native to the Feywild). The eladrin's name escapes him.

If the characters request more information about Zybilna and Prismeer, Madryck offers the following descriptions, based on firsthand knowledge that is somewhat out of date:

- Prismeer is a domain of delight ruled by Zybilna, who dwells in the Palace of Heart's Desire, a magnificent structure in the heart of the domain.
- Zybilna can assume many forms and is brilliant, secretive, and wise. (Madryck doesn't know Zybilna's secret identity, as revealed in [chapter 5](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#wbtw,5).)
- When she presents herself to mortals, Zybilna usually assumes the form of a statuesque woman with long white hair and a small tattoo shaped like a chicken's foot below one eye.

Each character who hears Madryck's description of Zybilna suddenly recalls a forgotten childhood memory of her, which you can determine by having that character's player roll on the Childhood Memories table.
