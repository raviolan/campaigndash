The character regains the ability to smile by holding this wand for the first time.

### Odo
**Handwriting.** To all other creatures, the character's handwriting is illegible and requires a [comprehend languages](https://5e.tools/spells.html#comprehend%20languages_phb) spell or similar magic to decipher.

The DM chooses the kind of instrument. When the character plays this instrument for the first time, their handwriting becomes legible.

**Three Inches of Height.** The character suffering from this loss knows they are shorter than they ought to be.

## Minor Curses

At your discretion, each character who lost something as a child might carry a minor curse as well. Unlike the inability to gain inspiration, this minor curse can be lifted with a [remove curse](https://5e.tools/spells.html#remove%20curse_phb) spell or similar magic. The nature of the minor curse affecting each character depends on which hag took what the character lost. After rolling on the Keepers of Lost Things table for each character, consult the Minor Curses table to determine what minor curse besets that character.
