**Slanty Tower.** The characters encounter a native of the Feywild but an outsider to Prismeer: [Sir Talavar](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#sir%20talavar_wbtw), a gallant faerie dragon knight in the service of the Summer Queen. From [Sir Talavar](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#sir%20talavar_wbtw), the characters learn that Zybilna has been overthrown by the hags of the Hourglass Coven.

Telemy Hill. This encounter serves as a cautionary tale, warning the characters about what becomes of those who are too cavalier about bargains made with a hag. The characters meet a goblin named [Jingle Jangle](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#jingle%20jangle_wbtw), who has an obsession for collecting keys.

Brigands' Tollway. The last of these encounters is with a native of Prismeer who remembers what the domain was like before the Hourglass Coven shattered it. [Agdon Longscarf](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#agdon%20longscarf_wbtw), a nefarious bandit leader, can tell the characters how to reach Downfall if they get the better of him.
