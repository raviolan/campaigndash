### Tihildur’s Connection to Cyrieth   
###### Family Relationship:
- Cyrieth Nerolien is Tihildur Salabaster II’s **uncle**, the estranged brother of Tihildur’s father. Cyrieth’s actions and personality contrast sharply with Tihildur’s domineering and morally ambiguous father.
- Cyrieth and Tihildur’s father were once allies, involved in questionable dealings that helped solidify the Salabaster Shipping Company’s dominance. However, a rift grew between them when Tihildur’s father sought to distance himself from Cyrieth's more overt criminal activities in order to build a legitimate image. 

###### Role in Tihildur’s Life:
- Tihildur recalls Cyrieth from his youth as a dangerous but charismatic figure who was often associated with his father’s rise to power. Cyrieth’s behavior planted seeds of doubt and discontent in Tihildur’s mind about his family’s methods and morality.
- Tihildur’s hatred for his father extends to Cyrieth, whom he blames for furthering his father’s corrupt empire and influencing Tihildur’s early life. 
###### Current Dynamic:
- Tihildur is unaware of the full extent of Cyrieth’s betrayal of Valkrath or his continued manipulations. However, the reveal of these events during the campaign could force Tihildur to confront his family’s legacy and his own ambitions.
- Cyrieth may attempt to manipulate Tihildur against his father, exploiting Tihildur’s deep-seated resentment while concealing his own ulterior motives

### Valkrath's Connection to Cyrieth

###### Mentor-Turned-Betrayer:
- Valkrath Bloodscale, a red dragonborn paladin, was mentored by Cyrieth in his youth. Cyrieth appeared as a savior figure, teaching Valkrath the ways of the paladin and guiding him out of his dire circumstances.
- However, Cyrieth’s mentorship was a ploy. He used Valkrath as a pawn in his schemes, including selling out other strong individuals like Valkrath to slavers for personal gain. This betrayal shattered Valkrath’s trust and fueled his oath of vengeance. 
  
###### Catalyst for Vengeance:
- During a heated confrontation, Valkrath discovered Cyrieth’s true nature. Cyrieth had orchestrated the destruction of their shared order, “The Deathgrins,” and was involved in slavery and banditry that preyed on innocent lives. This culminated in Cyrieth killing the guildmaster of their order to cover his tracks.
- After this betrayal, Cyrieth disappeared, leaving Valkrath to rebuild his shattered life. Valkrath swore an oath to hunt Cyrieth down and destroy not only him but also his bloodline, considering their ignorance of Cyrieth’s crimes as complicity. 

###### Current Dynamic:
- Valkrath views Cyrieth as the embodiment of betrayal and corruption, making him the central figure in Valkrath’s oath of vengeance.
- The revelation that Tihildur is Cyrieth’s nephew will create immediate tension between the two party members. Valkrath may struggle with seeing Tihildur as an extension of Cyrieth’s evil or as an innocent victim of Cyrieth’s manipulation

### Shared Plotlines
###### Revealing the Connection:
Initially, neither Tihildur nor Valkrath knows the full extent of their shared connection to Cyrieth. The reveal can serve as a climactic moment, possibly during an encounter with Cyrieth or through discovery of his past crimes.

###### Conflict and Tension:
Cyrieth’s betrayal creates trust issues between Valkrath and Tihildur, as Valkrath grapples with his hatred for Cyrieth’s bloodline. Meanwhile, Tihildur may feel defensive or betrayed by learning how his uncle’s actions have shaped others’ lives. 

###### Themes of Betrayal and Redemption:
Tihildur and Valkrath’s arcs can explore themes of breaking free from a dark legacy. Tihildur’s growth from a privileged but resentful noble into a self-determined figure parallels Valkrath’s journey of reclaiming agency and justice.
