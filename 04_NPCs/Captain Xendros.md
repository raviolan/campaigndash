Relationships: [[Nyx]]
Related Shops: [[Shops Index]] - Black market alternative to standard merchants

Xendros’s criminal ties, Iuz connections, and pursuit of magical items play a pivotal role in Nyx’s quest and the black market intrigue.

- Xendros doesn’t want to rule Saltmarsh; she wants **pull** everywhere.  
- She spots talented, morally-flexible people and recruits them into her informal “roster”.  
- She then **brokers connections**: clients with agendas ⇄ specialists who can do the dirty work.  
- Every job is a test. Success = she invests more in you. Failure = you become a loose end… or a bargaining chip.  
- Nyx is currently on **probation**. Xendros is deciding whether to treat her as an asset, a rival, or a future sacrifice.
#### Protect a Brotherhood agent

- Xendros gets paid to ensure that a certain “merchant” or “diplomat” **leaves town alive**.
- That “merchant” is actually a **Scarlet Brotherhood operative** the party is trying to expose or stop.
- Xendros doesn’t care about ideology; she only cares that a valuable client sees their flunky walk away safely.
- Nyx is told:  
    “I don’t care what happens around him. I care that he leaves breathing.”
    - Tests Nyx’s loyalty vs party loyalty.
    - Entangles Xendros with the Scarlet Brotherhood/Cyrieth side without making her their puppet
    - Feels very on-theme for “she connects shady people with shady people.”
