nervous half-elf barmaid/bookkeeper with [[Scarlet Brotherhood]] connections
works at the [[Bent Willow Tavern]]

- **Front**: shy, good with numbers, runs tabs for locals.
- **Truth**: she keeps a second set of books for Brotherhood/Cyrieth jobs; can hint that “the man you seek likes to be paid in secrets, not coin.”
- **Hook**: If the party protects her from rowdy smugglers or pays well, she’ll reveal that Cyrieth’s people meet in the Bent Willow once a tenday.
- **Attitude**: Starts Indifferent. Becomes Friendly if:
	- PCs help her with rowdy patrons
	- Or overpay for drinks / tip generously
	- Or show kindness when she’s clearly stressed.
- **Revealing information** (layered):
1. **General shadiness (easy)**
    - Trigger: casual chat + DC **11 Persuasion** or a kind gesture.
    - She admits: “Some customers are… better left unmentioned,” and hints the tavern attracts “important” but dangerous patrons.
        
2. **Brotherhood/coded meetings (medium)**
    - Trigger: target her with pointed questions about symbols / strange guests + DC **13 Persuasion** _or_ show her you spotted the scarlet knot / red cord.
    - She reveals: “Certain people meet here once a tenday; we hang the red cord when they’ve booked the private room.”
        
3. **Cyrieth link (hard)**
    - Trigger: promise of protection + solid trust, or 5–10 gp bribe + DC **15 Persuasion / Insight** to reassure her.
    - She quietly mentions a **man who pays in secrets**, never the same face twice, who “likes to let others think they hired him, but he’s always the one making the list.”
    - You can have her use an alias (“The Serpent” or “Master Nerol”) long before she says “Cyrieth”.'
