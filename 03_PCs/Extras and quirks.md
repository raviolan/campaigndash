## Tenebris (Too Slick to Function)

- You are a fluid shadow of elegance and motion. People don’t notice you—you just happen.  
- Ghost Step: If you roll a 25+ on Stealth, you are considered invisible to anyone not actively searching for you (DM discretion). People must succeed a DC 15 Insight check to notice you’ve even entered the room… unless you choose to be seen.  
- Accidental Style: Every time you roll a natural 20 on Acrobatics or Sleight of Hand, NPCs around you applaud. Even enemies.

🐍 Tenebris’s “Way Too Much Dexterity™” Side Effects  
The Involuntary Stealth Problem: People never know when he’s around. Not because he’s hiding—he just moves that quietly. NPCs get startled constantly. Tavern owners have started putting bells on the doors just because of him.  
  
💃 Movement So Smooth It’s Suspicious  
His walk is so graceful that people assume he’s a noble, an assassin, or both.  He gets stopped at borders and checkpoints all the time. “Sir, you’re clearly a spy. No one moves like that.”  Cats follow him. Moths orbit him. He moves like wind over silk.  

## Tihildur (Charisma Consequences)

😍 Unintended Entourage
Wherever he goes, he gathers admirers. Barmaids, guards, stable boys, nobles—they all find excuses to linger nearby. Town criers start adding his name to headlines. “Storm Damages Roofs—Tihildur Unaffected, Still Glorious.” In cities, people graffiti his name in calligraphy and flowers. 

💅🏽 Diva Dilemma: You have disadvantage on Stealth or Deception checks if you’re not intentionally downplaying your presence. You’re just too dang shiny.

🕯️ Cult-y Devotion
A group of peasants has declared him a reincarnated celestial being. They follow him quietly, offering baked goods and poetry. He once gave a poor child a silver coin—now the kid wears it on a necklace and recites “The Words of Tihildur” as scripture.

🎭 The Curse of the Spotlight
In stealth missions, he keeps getting noticed despite great rolls. “Something about him just... stands out.” He’s constantly invited to give speeches at events he wasn’t attending. Local plays keep writing roles based on him. He once disguised himself… only for someone to say, “You look like that guy in ‘Tihildur: The Musical.’” 

💔 Emotional Wake
NPCs fall for him left and right. It complicates negotiations. “I’ll lower the toll… if you’ll write me a poem.” Rejections are devastating. Former admirers become bitter enemies or tragically obsessed. Even enemies hesitate to kill him. “He’s just so... radiant. Is it warm in here?” 

🧠 Mind-Altering Presence
Creatures immune to charm still feel something. “I can’t explain it. I just want him to like me.” Animals roll over for belly rubs. Undead pause mid-attack to fix their posture.
Magic mirrors tell him he’s the fairest every time.
