### The Salabaster-Sanbalet Connection
Business Relationship: Daddy Salabaster is first and foremost a pragmatic businessman. He doesn’t care who he works with, as long as it’s profitable. While he runs a legitimate shipping empire on the surface, he’s no stranger to turning a blind eye to shadier business ventures if the price is right—particularly smuggling operations. 
Sanbalet's Role: [[Sanbalet]] is a mid-level player in [[Saltmarsh]]'s smuggling world. He works with [[Salabaster Shipping]] through intermediaries, ensuring plausible deniability for [[Daddy Salabaster]]. The goods being smuggled through Sanbalet’s operation range from mundane contraband (illegal imports, untaxed goods) to more dangerous items like black-market alchemical supplies and magical artifacts. 
Primewater's Involvement: [[Gellan Primewater]] is a high-value client for both [[Sanbalet]] and [[Salabaster Shipping]]. He uses Salabaster’s services for legal trade but also benefits from the smuggling network. Disrupting Sanbalet’s operation would jeopardize that relationship, something [[Daddy Salabaster]] would prefer to avoid.

Daddy Salabaster’s Reaction to Tihildur’s Actions
Daddy Salabaster is a cold, calculating man, but he has complicated feelings about his son’s meddling. 
Business First: He’s undoubtedly angry and annoyed that Tihildur interfered in a delicate situation, especially if it risks exposing the smuggling ring or losing Primewater as a client. He will scold and reprimand Tihildur, reminding him that “business is not a playground for petulant noble brats.” 
Opportunity for Growth: Despite his frustration, he might recognize Tihildur’s ambition and view this as a chance to mold him. Daddy Salabaster’s long-term goal is to bring Tihildur into the fold—not just to take over the shipping empire, but to understand the hidden layers of power that fuel it. He might decide that it’s time for Tihildur to learn how things really work.
The Offer: "If you want to meddle in my business, then fine. Let’s see how you do when you’re on the inside. But remember—this is not a game. One wrong move, and there are consequences beyond your worst imaginings."

Ultimatum: Depending on how Tihildur responds, Daddy Salabaster could give him an ultimatum:
Work for him officially, learning the family trade under his direct supervision.
Or be cut off from the family, left to fend for himself with no access to family resources or influence.
Daddy Salabaster might even consider arranging a political marriage to tie Tihildur more deeply into the family’s affairs—something Tihildur would likely hate.

Sanbalet’s Knowledge
Sanbalet’s parting words to Tihildur were full of implications:
He Knows About the Smuggling Business: He understands exactly how he fits into the larger web of Salabaster Shipping’s operations. His taunt to Tihildur was both a warning and a test.
He Doesn’t Want to Get on Daddy’s Bad Side: Sanbalet might respect Daddy Salabaster’s power but doesn’t fear him enough to stay loyal forever. He’s opportunistic and could be working with other factions, like the [[Scarlet Brotherhood]], to hedge his bets.
He Sees Tihildur as a Threat: If Tihildur is serious about taking over the family business, Sanbalet knows that Tihildur could complicate his life—and maybe even cut him out entirely.
