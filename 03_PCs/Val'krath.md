### Val'Krath Deep Lore
 
As a youngling, I, Valkrath was the sole red Dragonborne in the suburban area where I grew up. As all Dragonborne of the Chromatic Decent, the sense of what is right and wrong, is often dulled and the lines are blurred. Being the sole Red one, I was often picked on and beaten by the Elder ones of the village. As a result, I went and lived in a cave outside the tiny village. I fetched water from the ceiling in large leaves, however, flod was scarce. I managed to get by from foraging berries, catching the occational rodent and stealing food whenever I musterd enough courage to visit the village.
 
After a few years an ancient hero of the Dragonborne named Thane Dovahkiin and offered food. Thane lived outside the village aswell as he had grown tired of the ways of the younger generations. He told me stories of his adventures and how he created this place for our kin to thrive and work together, to eventually carry out the mission of Tiamat, the original Chromatic Dragon and Goddess among Gods. Thane thaught me alot of the past and how to act, make food and how to pray during his many visits.
A few years after this had all begun, I came how after finding a sickened tree and birdsnest in the woods. Hoping to show this to Thane as I understood that something was awfully wrong and wanting to find out what. As I came closer, I found blood had stained the entrance of my cave. I crouched slowly to see what was going on, but couldn’t find any signs of life. I lowered my guard as I saw a lifeless but familiar body on the floor. I lept forward when I realized it was Thane. He had brought me some bread, however, they were almost all eaten… I immediately understood that they were still close by, but just who could it have been? Just as I had that thought everything went black.
 
As I woke up I was tied with my hands behind my back, outside my cave in a camp, and I heard a high-pitched laughter. As I had never seen someone else than a Dragonborne, I was chocked when I saw these bony creatures lurking in front of me.
Nowadays I know that they were a Thiefling and an Orc, dressed in ragged clothing and hoods. They told me that they came a long way to find a Red Dragonborne in order to use me for their work or sell my hide if I didn’t cooperate. While they were eating and telling me what they wanted me to do, I felt a presence that seemed omnious and growing stronger enter my head, and in the flickering light of the campfire, I saw her; Tiamat. She started to speak and it felt as her voice was coming from inside my head.
”Young one, noone can tame a Dragon, we are the ones meant to rule the world. These weak creatures can’t do you no harm of you decide to take control of the power you have brewing deep inside.”
The Orc suddenly hit me in the ribs with a mallet as he got angry that I was drifting away and not answering them. I screamed out of paint and I once again heard Tiamats voice in my head; ”You are weak young Darasv, but you are of my blood, you must grow stronger and take charge. Kill these Dokaals and march the path of the Dragon!”
As I calmed down the Orc and the Thiefling had decided to inflict more pain before transporting me back to their crew. They tried stabbing me with a small knife, however my hide and scales where thick enough for it to break apart. So they continued striking me with a mallet as it had previously worked. After a few more blows I heard Tiamat utter a single word as I began to feel a burning in my stomach.
 
*Tiamats Malicious Voice*
”IXEN”
 
As I heard the word being uttered, I spewed fire and I could hear the flesh of my assailants stating to melt, their blood boiling and their screams filled my heart with fear; aswell as pride and joy. This was the first time I ever breathed fire, I finally felt powerful.
The fire stopped as suddenly as it had began; and the corpses of my assailants where nothing but ashes left on the ground. As I looked toward the campfire, I saw Tiamat fading away with a smirky smile on her face.
I managed to free myself from my restraints using the belt buckle lying in a pile of ashes. I grabbed the mallet they had hit me with and sat down by a tree and cried myself to sleep.
 
 
I woke up a few hours later when I heard a twig snapped, I hid by some nearby bushes with the mallet ready to strike.
Into the camp wandered a beautiful creature, its strides made him seem like he was floating across the ground. The creature had on an armor that seemed otherwordly, it was Dark Black with purple details and a long mantle that had a shine unlike any material I could ever believe could came from this world. It was obvious this creature was rich beyond the wildest dreams.
It went to the ashes and remains of my slain foes and muttered something in a language I couldn’t understand. I misstakenly made a sound as I breathed out in awe and the creature turned around with his massive sword drawn.
I thought ”How could I ever have missed that giant weapon?”
He calmly said ”Is this your doing, young Dragonborne?”
I slowly exited from my hiding spot with the mallet held high, ready to strike if needed, and nodded.
The creature lowered his sword and took a step forward.
”For such a young Dragonborne, you managed very well to fend of these bandits. I am sorry to not have arrived earlier, I have been tracking them and their pack for a while. Let me introduce myself, my name is Cyrieth Nerolien. I am a Paladin of the Brothergood of Those Who Smile in the Face of Death, or shortly called: The Deathgrins. We are hunters of evil and these bandits have been laying waste to villages in their path and enslaved strong ones like yourself. I just took care of their companions, so noone will came after you.”
As I lowered my mace I asked ”What are you and what is a Paladin”
He explained that he was a Half-Elf from far away and that Paladins were instruments of Justice, in any way you thought Justice could be provided. He was one of influence and power belonging to a military background.
The word power resonated with me and I ask to join him as an apprentice.
I still keep the mallet with me. 
 
Several years passed and I got taught the ways of the Paladin from Cyrieth and the Deathgrins. However I always kept the feeling of Tiamat gave me and I realized that I couldn’t join the ranks of the Deathgrins, I needed to be in service of her. The day I was going to tell Cyrieth and the Guildmaster, I walked in on something I shouldn’t have seen. Outside the Guildmasters quarters I noticed the door were unlocked and I heard voices shouting, so I peeked in. Cyrieth and the Guildmaster were having an argument, apparently Cyrieth had broken his vows and was in charge of the bandit gangs roaming around the suburbean areas. Enslaving strong creatures to do his bidding or selling them for money and favours.
As the argument went on to become more heated, he eventually drew his sword and beheaded the Guildmaster. When he saw me in the dooropening, he let out a fierce and menacing power as he screamed that I was not supposed to be there. He forced his way through and knocked me out cold.
 
When I woke up, our keep was on fire and many of my fellow Paladins were slain.
Til this day, noone have found him.
 
My mission, no my OATH, is one of Vengeance.
I vow to find and end him, he and all who have abided him shall taste fear as I show them the Wrath that has been brewing inside of me.
Anyone within his bloodline shall also be punished for their crime of ignorance, that they have let him do this unpunished is a crime I cannot forgive.
By the power of Tiamat, I swear that this shall happen.
If I fail or stray from my path, she may smite me down and abandon me, even if I will never abandon her.
