### Long resting in the wild
Baseline: what “interrupts a long rest”?

If you want to stay close to 5e RAW:

A long rest is 8 hours.

If it’s interrupted by 1 hour or more of strenuous activity (fighting, walking, casting spells, etc.), they don’t get the benefits and basically need to start over.

In practice, a single 3-round fight is ~18 seconds – not 1 hour – so you can rule:

Short, sharp encounter = rest still counts.
Multiple or drawn-out events = rest is compromised.

You get to define where the line is.

2. A simple “night procedure” for you

Each time they long rest in the woods:

They set watch order.
You know who’s awake when.

You decide how many encounter checks to roll.

Common: 2–3 checks per night (early, middle, late).

Roll on your Fey-leak table or a combat table depending on vibe.

When something happens, classify it as:

A. Atmosphere only (weird but non-strenuous)

B. Brief disturbance (short interaction / tiny scene)

C. Serious interruption (fight, chase, big social scene)

Then apply mechanics:

3. How each type affects the long rest
A. Atmosphere only

Examples: odd lights, animals watching, singing wind, shared dream flashes.

No mechanical effect on the rest at all.

Whoever is on watch can wake others if they want, but it doesn’t break the long rest.

Use these a lot. They build tension without punishment.

B. Brief disturbance

Examples: quick social interaction, a 1–2 round scare, small Fey prank.

Rule of thumb:

If the whole thing is over in 10 in-game minutes or less,

And doesn’t require marching away from camp,

→ Long rest still succeeds, but:

People who got dragged in might:

Make a Con save vs. fatigue if they never got back to proper sleep, or

Get no benefit from hit dice/HP recovery, but still get spell slots, OR

Suffer disadvantage on the first check they make next morning.

Pick one simple consequence and keep it consistent.

C. Serious interruption

Examples: full combat, chase, big hag negotiation, moving camp.

If it takes an hour or more in-game or obviously counts as strenuous:

You’ve got two main options:

Option 1 – RAW strict

The long rest fails.

They got a short rest instead.

Next day they:

Don’t regain spell slots/HP as normal,

Might gain 1 level of exhaustion if you want to be harsh.

This is punishing; I’d use it sparingly unless you want a very gritty feel.

Option 2 – Gentler “delayed rest”

They still get their long rest,

but it takes longer: 8 hours + the interruption.

That means they might:

Wake up later than planned,

Lose some daylight,

Arrive at places at more awkward times.

This keeps pressure without constant exhaustion spam.

4. Easy homebrew rule you can tell the players (if you want)

To keep it clean at the table, you can codify:

“If you get one quick encounter at night, your long rest is fine.
If you get two or more serious interruptions, the best you get is a short rest, and you’re tired in the morning.”

You don’t have to say “two or more” out loud, but you can run it as:

First big event: fine, but you note it.

Second big event that same night: now we’re in “no long rest” territory or “everyone makes a Con save vs exhaustion.”

5. How this plays with your Fey-leak theme

Most of your weird Fey events should be A or B: creepy, unsettling, maybe mechanically tiny, but not stopping the long rest.

Save C events (actual danger / big NPC scenes) for nights when you want them to feel worn down or off-schedule.

This way:

The woods feel alive and odd,

The party doesn’t dread ever trying to sleep,

Interrupted rests become story beats, not constant punishment.
### Underwater combat:
- Movement: Creatures without a swim speed move at half speed (swimming counts like difficult terrain). Dash works as normal. 
- Combat: Keep the standard underwater rules: 
- Melee: Disadvantage unless it’s dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident. 
- Ranged: Auto-miss beyond normal range; within normal range it’s disadvantage unless crossbow, net, or thrown javelin/spear/trident/dart.

- Ranged spell attacks aren’t penalized by the underwater combat section (though fire damage is still resisted when fully submerged). 
- Breathing: PCs need water breathing (spell, potion, item) or some other solution. Holding breath is possible but gives no verbal spellcasting and is risky for longer fights. 
- Verbal components: If a creature can breathe (via magic or an air source), let them speak and cast normally. If they’re holding breath, speaking ends that breath and they risk suffocation. 
- Let non-swimmers spend an object interaction to kick off a wall/door and move an extra 5 ft once per round—keeps scenes dynamic
