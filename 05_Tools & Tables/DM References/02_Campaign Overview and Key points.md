#### Ghosts of Saltmarsh:
- Sahuagin vs. Lizardfolk
	- Ties into Tihildur's family and the shipping company
	- Smuggling and Xanathar influence? subtle signs of criminal syndicates encroaching on Saltmarsh, linked to Valkrath, Tihildur's and Nyx's respective backstories. 
	- Thieves' guild intrigue - involves Nyx and Captain Xendros criminal ties and can bring in the Agile Hand and/or Xanathars

### Next Steps - Campaign Shape Outline (new cannon)
### Act 0: Saltmarsh Prologue
**End state (where we are now):**
- PCs are:
    - Paid, recognised, and a little burnt out on Saltmarsh politics.
    - Aware that something bigger and weirder is happening (storm, omens).

- Unresolved threads:    
    - Two lower levels of the sahuagin fortress.
    - Brotherhood meddling and Cyrieth’s deeper web.
    - Xendros’s interest in Nyx.
        
- They are **packing up and leaving** Saltmarsh along the Old King’s Road – directly into Act 1.

### Act 1: The Crack in the World
**Focus:**  
Travel along the storm-shattered ward-stone line, discover the leak, and meet the first wave of Fey / Brotherhood / Cyrieth entanglements.

**Beats:**
- Travel days using your **weather** and **random encounter** tables to show reality misbehaving.    
- Tihildur’s **storm performance** scene (Call Lightning moment), deepening his bond with the storm and guilt about the crack.
- Checkpoint scene with petty officials and hints of Witchlight/Fey traffic.
- Xendros’ letter framing Nyx’s journey as walking “a crack in the world” and outlining her three concerns (Sanbalet’s supplier, Constantori’s painting, the whispering sky).
    
- Arrival at the **Bent Willow Tavern**:
    - Ellywick & Diana as Feywild foreshadowing.
    - Goblin wrestling and carnival energy.
    - Glitching mirror as visible sign of the leak.
    - Lysa, Brother Calem, Garrik + hidden symbols as your **Brotherhood/Cyrieth connection hub**.
        

**Climax of Act 1:**
- PCs realise **explicitly** that:
        - The Feywild is leaking here (through the mirror / ward-stone scars / Diana’s suffering).
        - The storm that empowered Tihildur is the _same_ event that cracked the world.
        - Mortals (Cyrieth, Brotherhood, smugglers) were tugging at the ward-stones before the storm hit.
        
- They now have a **choice**:
     - Investigate and try to stabilise the leak,
    - Go after mortal culprits first (Cyrieth/Brotherhood),
    - Or ignore it and move on, accepting escalating weirdness.
        

**End state:**
- The Bent Willow is established as a recurring safe-but-shifty hub.
- They know: “We’re not just dealing with sahuagin anymore; the world itself is cracked.”
- A path is open either **through** the leak (Feywild) or **along** it to its source.
### Act 2 – Through the Tear (Feywild / Prismeer)

**Focus:**  
Crossing into Feywild/Prismeer, confronting personal baggage and the hag-driven chaos behind the scenes.

**Beats:**

- First forays into Feywild domain(s) accessible via the crack/mirror.
    
- Emotional, surreal challenges that mirror PC issues:
    
    - Tenebris’ Shadowfell/Raven Queen fears.
        
    - Tihildur’s guilt/power dynamic with the storm.
        
    - Nyx caught between Xendros’ tests and tempting Fey bargains.
        
- Evidence that the **Hourglass Coven** has carved up Prismeer and is exploiting planar weak spots like this leak (even if Diana can’t say it, others can show it).
    
- Cyrieth’s trail leads here:
    
    - Maybe he’s trying to **weaponise** the leak or secure Fey allies/blackmail.
        

**Climax of Act 2:**

- Major confrontation:
    
    - Against a hag (or her lieutenant),
        
    - Or against **Cyrieth** at/near the leak’s heart, with Brotherhood stakes and Xendros’ agenda in the background.
        
- PCs make a **big choice** about the crack:
    
    - Seal it (sacrifice / cost, especially for Tihildur),
        
    - Stabilise it (controlled gate, ongoing weirdness),
        
    - Or intentionally twist it for their own/others’ use.
        

**End state:**

- The immediate planar wound is resolved one way or another.
    
- Cyrieth is defeated, escaped, or transformed into a different kind of threat.
    
- Each PC has confronted at least one personal arc beat in the Feywild.

### Act 3 – Optional: Deep Lore & Dawn Incarnate

**Focus:**  
If everyone’s still hungry at higher levels, this act lets you cash in the _deep myth_ threads without forcing them.

**Beats (only if you want them):**

- Rumours and research about the **golden beast that eats greed** resurface.
    
- Links to Radiant Citadel and the Stone Library become actionable.
    
- The party can seek the _truth_ behind the dawn-coloured guardian once hinted at in the region’s myths.
    

**Climax of Act 3:**

- They find or awaken the **Dawn Incarnate** (or choose not to).
    
- Decision:
    
    - Restore a powerful guardian to balance the region,
        
    - Bind or relocate it,
        
    - Or ensure it never rises again.
        

**End state:**

- The coast (and maybe the planes nearby) are irrevocably shaped by their choices.
    
- Perfect “epilogue movie” for the campaign if everyone still wants more story.

If you’d like, next step we can zoom in on _just_ Act 1 and turn it into a one-page DM flowchart: “Checkpoint → weather/encounters → storm performance → Bent Willow beats (with which NPC to bring forward depending on who bites).”
