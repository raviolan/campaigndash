## Official D&D 5e Creature (Monster Manual)
**Dao (Earth Genie)**
*Large elemental, neutral evil*

Dao are greedy, malicious genies from the Elemental Plane of Earth. In their natural form, dao are large, apparently muscular humanoids 8-11 feet tall. They adorn themselves with jewelry crafted from precious gems and rare metals, and when they fly, their lower bodies become columns of swirling sand.

**Key Abilities**:
- **Earth Glide**: Can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing the material
- **Elemental Demise**: If killed, body disintegrates into crystalline powder
- **Sure-Footed**: Advantage on saves against being knocked prone
- **Innate Spellcasting** (Charisma-based, spell save DC 14):
  - At will: *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*, *stone shape*
  - 3/day each: *passwall*, *move earth*, *tongues*
  - 1/day each: *conjure elemental* (earth only), *gaseous form*, *invisibility*, *phantasmal killer*, *plane shift*, *wall of stone*

**Combat**: Multiattack with maul attacks that can knock targets prone, or unarmed strikes.
