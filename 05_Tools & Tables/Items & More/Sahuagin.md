## Campaign Context
Aquatic humanoids seeking to dominate coastal regions through terror and manipulation.

## Nature and Society
- Shark-like humanoids with predatory culture
- Follow [[Sekolah]] - demonic shark deity encouraging slaughter and dominance
- Enjoy torture and terror as spiritually strengthening experiences
- Consider sea elves ([[Oceanus]]'s people) as mortal enemies through ancient blood feuds

## Current Operations
- **Coastal Dominance**: Want to control sea routes and coastal settlements
- **[[Saltmarsh]] Threat**: Operating from corrupted [[Lizardfolk]] island stronghold
- **Political Manipulation**: Working to prevent restoration of [[Dawn Incarnate]]
- **Propaganda Campaign**: Spread fear about [[Aurumvorax]] to keep portal to [[Radiant Citadel]] closed

## Key Relationships
- **[[Kedjou]]**: Allied wizard who created Nightmare [[Aurumvorax]] for them
- **[[Oceanus]]**: Primary target as sea elf investigating their operations
- **[[Lizardfolk]]**: Displaced from island home, now held as corrupted stronghold
- **[[Dawn Incarnate]]**: Ancient enemy - its restoration would challenge their power

## Strategic Goals
- Maintain coastal dominance without interference from [[Radiant Citadel]]
- Prevent [[Dawn Incarnate]] restoration that could bring powerful outsiders
- Keep [[Lizardfolk]] from reclaiming their sacred homeland
- Expand terror and influence throughout the region

## Weaknesses
- Overconfidence in their aquatic advantage
- Dependence on [[Kedjou]]'s magical support for land operations
- Ancient enmity with sea elves creates predictable conflict patterns
- Corruption of sacred sites may be reversible with proper knowledge
