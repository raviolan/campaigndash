## Official D&D 5e Spell
**Call Lightning**
*3rd-level conjuration*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet  
- **Components:** V, S (Verbal and Somatic)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:** Druid

**Description**: A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet directly above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear.

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

**Stormy Conditions**: If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.

**At Higher Levels**: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
