## Official D&D Lore
"Dawn Incarnate" appears to be related to the **Radiant Citadel** from "Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel," a 5e adventure anthology. The Radiant Citadel is a haven in the Ethereal Plane that connects to multiple Material Plane worlds through portals, serving as a crossroads for various cultures and a place of learning and diplomacy.

Guardian spirits and protective entities are common themes in D&D lore, often serving as:
- **Celestial Guardians**: Divine beings tasked with protecting specific locations
- **Nature Spirits**: Manifestations of natural locations' protective essence
- **Artifacts of Power**: Items containing the essence of protective entities
- **Planar Anchors**: Entities that maintain connections between planes

The concept fits well with established D&D themes of protective spirits bound to artifacts like the **Emerald Heart**.

- Guardian spirit went dormant, leaving region vulnerable

## Current Status
